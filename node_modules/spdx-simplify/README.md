# spdx-simplify
Simplifies a SPDX expression (including ones with sub-expressions) down to a list of license choices. Licenses that are OR'd together will be returned as-is and licenses that are AND'd together will be returned as `MultipleLicenses`.

# Usage
```
var simplify = require('spdx-simplify');
var licenses = simplify('MIT OR BSD-2-Clause'); // Returns: ['MIT', 'BSD-2-Clause']
```
